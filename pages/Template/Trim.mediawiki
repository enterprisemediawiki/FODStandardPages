<noinclude>
This template removes whitespace from the beginning of strings. So if you have a value like " This is some text ", and pass it through this template, it will return "This is some text".

This is helpful sometimes in other templates, where the user may leave whitespace on the front of a template parameter, which could make it display poorly.

== Usage ==
<pre>
{{Trim| {{{parameter|}}} }}
</pre>

== How it works ==
All this template does is pass the parameter through the #if parser function. The #if parser function trims whitespace off of values before testing them, so we can use this side-effect to create a trim function.
