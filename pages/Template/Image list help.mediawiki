'''Example:'''
<pre>
jsc2010e098690
jsc2002e36651##               Include a caption like this if you want, using two hash symbols
File:My local file name.jpg## Use either IO IDs or local images
File:My image.jpg##           You can add lots of spaces before captions to keep the code neat
</pre>

Enter either local file names (images on the wiki) or [[Imagery Online]] IDs into the image list field, each on its own line.
* Enter local images in the form: "File:My local file name.jpg"
* Enter Imagery online IDs in the form: "jsc2002e36651"
* Add captions by following the image name/ID with two hashes (##) and the caption
** Don't make captions too long or it will look bad
